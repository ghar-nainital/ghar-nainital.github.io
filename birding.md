If you agree that taking a stroll in nature or some arduous hike is a great way to find that peace of mind, we assure you birding will do you one up. You could be walking or hiking to de-stress yourself but those thoughts could still get to you. Birding is a very engaging activity where you with your body and mind will be present and have that headspace! 

Now did you know there are about 140 bird species which call Nainital their home? That is about 12% of number of birds you can find in India! Not bad for such a small and accessible place. We ourselves have identified 105 of them. Maybe you can help us with the rest? What's more, upto 600 species visit the district for breeding!

You will find a dedicated section on the birds we have successfully identified here casually with information such as the location, the time, the month, some personal observations and ofcourse, all the pictures we took! We hope this will give you a good starting point to ID new birds to your life list :)
