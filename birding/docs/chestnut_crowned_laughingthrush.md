## Description from eBird:
Beautifully patterned but shy laughingthrush of the central Himalayas. Note black neck spots and golden wing and tail panels. Western “Chestnut-crowned” birds have soft orange crowns, while eastern “Black-eared” individuals have dark faces and gray-streaked crowns. Forages in small groups in the dense undergrowth of hill and mountain forests; sometimes gathers in larger numbers in the winter. Song consists of inflected squeaky whistles. Calls include churring, rattling, and slurred squeaking.
