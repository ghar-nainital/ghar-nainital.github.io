## Description from eBird:
A dove with attractive plumage: rufous-scaled scapulars and wing coverts, dusky underparts, and a black-and-white striped patch on the side of its neck made of silver-tipped feathers. There is a considerable variation in plumage in different subspecies. The southernmost populations are resident while the others migrate down south during winter. Breeds in open lowland woods and copses with rich undergrowth. Rather shy and keep well hidden in the tree canopy. Call is two hoarse notes followed by two clear notes "hr-hr oo-oo."
