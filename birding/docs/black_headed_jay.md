## Description from eBird:
Largely gray with a black head, a scruffy crest, white streaks on the throat, and a pale bill. The wings and tail are blue through the middle with black barring, leading to thick black and white bands. It is omnivorous and feeds on the ground and in the trees. It can be quite bold and often occurs around human habitation, where it may feed off garbage dumps and agricultural land. The calls include a few raspy and nasal variants of a harsh “kraaa.”
