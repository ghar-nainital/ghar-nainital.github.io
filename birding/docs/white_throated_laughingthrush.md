## Description from eBird:
Warm brown with an ochre-colored belly and pure white throat, this laughingthrush is found in foothill forests along the Himalayas and in central China. Several other laughingthrushes also have pale throats, but none are as plain and unmarked above as White-throated. Gives high whistles, often from within cover. Common in foothill forests and edges but will also occasionally venture into parks and gardens.
