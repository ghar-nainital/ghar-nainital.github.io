## Description from eBird:
Incandescently beautiful male is resplendent in electric blue and snowy white. Female is dull gray-brown with paler underparts. Slight regional variation: “Western” males have a short white eyebrow and “Eastern” females have a faint rusty patch on the forehead. Male may be confused with Himalayan Bluetail, but lacks orange. Female is similar to females of Slaty-blue and Little Pied Flycatchers, but lacks any rufous tones on the tail. Breeds in hill and montane broadleaf and pine forests; descends into lower foothills in winter. Rarely heard song a complex series of whistles and chatters; more commonly heard is the call, a dry trilling chatter, sometimes preceded by a short whistle.
