## Description from eBird:
Orangey-brown laughingthrush with fine streaking all over the body. Breeds at middle to upper elevations, sometimes descending in the winter. Often found around human habitation; also in forest edge and scrubby or bushy areas. Forages on the ground in pairs or small flocks. Song highly variable, brief but often complex; first note often starts off with a distinct bubbling quality. Gives various high call notes.
