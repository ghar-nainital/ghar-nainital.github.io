## Observation
Also bit common and thus easy to sight, hopping around in trees and bushes, rarely sitting in one place. Relatively bold, we could observe them from a comfortable distance without scaring them away.

## Description from eBird:
Colorful small songbird of foothill and montane forests (up to 2800 m). Similar to Japanese Tit in appearance but with a bright yellow belly, greenish back, and two narrow white wingbars rather than one broad one. Forages at middle and upper levels in forests, often in pairs or as part of mixed-species flocks. Song a series of 3-4 whistles. Calls infrequently, a gruff “deedeedee.”
