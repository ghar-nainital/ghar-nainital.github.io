## Sighting: Where and When
```yaml

1. near Thandi Sadak on bushes opposite to the lake-side
2. on a tree roughly middle of the route to St. Xaviers from Shiv-Mandir

```

## Observation
Not the most easiest to spot. Sits still when it does sit but quite timid and moves away quickly. Mostly stayed away from human-sight in trees and bushes. Saw once coming to an open field very briefly. Often the female was also nearby.

## Description from eBird:
Male is unmistakable, with his orange breast, belly, and tail and ultramarine-blue head and back. Female is brown with no wingbars and an orange tail and lower belly; watch out for the unique upside-down black ‘T’ on her tail. The species breeds in brushy open subalpine areas and winters in foothills in scrubby areas, field edges, and gardens. Like many other redstarts, often perches visibly, bobbing tail up and down. Song is a series of pleasant warbles and bubbly buzzing. Calls include a distinctive wet ticking, often preceded by a quiet whistled note.
