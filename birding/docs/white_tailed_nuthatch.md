## Description from eBird:
Simply-colored nuthatch with gray upperparts and pale orange underparts. Difficult to distinguish from similarly-colored nuthatches, but averages smaller than Chestnut-bellied Nuthatch, and has a bright white spot on the tail base and a clean tan vent instead of a white-and-orange-striped one. Resides in Himalayan foothills, where it often forages in the middle and upper levels with mixed-species flocks.
