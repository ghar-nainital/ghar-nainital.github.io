## Description from eBird:
An odd small redstart of open dry forests. Male doesnâ€™t look like any other redstarts; somewhat resembles magpie-robins, which do not share its range. Dark head and white wingbars are striking; slate-blue sheen on the cap is often not visible. Female has weak warm tones on the tail, unlike most other female redstarts, but her two white wingbars and white eye-ring are unique.
