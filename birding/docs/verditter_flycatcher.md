## Description from eBird:
Beautifully vivid turquoise-blue flycatcher. Adult male has dark lores. Juvenile is duller, with noticeably grayer underparts. Sits upright on exposed perches. Found in lowland and hill forests and forest edges. Song is high and undulating phrase of burry or trilled notes. Most common call is a strident “wheet!”
