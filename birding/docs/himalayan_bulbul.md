## Description from eBird:
Sharp-looking bulbul with a spiffy mohawk. Note black face and throat, bright white cheek spot, and yellow vent. A species of foothill and montane forested areas; also found in brush, gardens, and towns. Tame and unafraid of people. Typically in pairs or small flocks during the breeding season; congregates in large flocks at other times. Song is a short and rather nasal-sounding burst of gurgling warbles. Calls include dry raspings, chups, and squeaks.
