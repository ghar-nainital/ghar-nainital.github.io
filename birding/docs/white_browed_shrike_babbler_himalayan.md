## Description from eBird:
A small, stout bird with a large head, usually found at mid-level in forests. Male is smartly attired: clean white below and black above with a gray back, a white eyebrow, and two bright, flame-like orange stripes towards the wingtips. Females have the same general patterning, but are much more faded, replacing black with gray and orange with yellow-green. Often joins mixed flocks in foothill and montane forests, where it can be fairly common. Song is a forceful series with slight breaks every second or third note: “dyudyu-dyu-dyudyu!”
