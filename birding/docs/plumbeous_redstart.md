## Description from eBird:
Small, sturdy songbird of fast-flowing streams and rivers. Regularly ventures into waterside human settlements, around dams, levees, and canals. Male is slaty gray-blue with a brilliant orange tail that is often fanned. Female and juvenile are gunmetal gray with scaly undersides and bright white on the upper half of the tail. High, whistled vocalizations can often be surprisingly audible, even over roaring water.
