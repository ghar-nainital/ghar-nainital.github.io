## Observation
One can always hear the louds hoots in the morning. Interestingly, most of the people we talked to thought it's a Koyal! Not the easiest to spot despite its loud hoots. Once getting into proximty of the tree where the hoot is coming from, both times we spotted them all the way on the top of the trees. There must be quite a few here from the loud calls in the morning but still not easy to spot. Quite okay with human presence for once we saw one unnerve sitting right in front of us as it were picking up on flowers.

## Description from eBird:
This largest of the barbets is colorful, but often appears all-dark from a distance. No other barbet in its range combines the features of a massive pale bill, black head, and dark olive back. Sluggish and shy; tends to stick to dense forest canopy, where it is difficult to see. Its loud hooting song (typically a series of two repetitive notes) is often the only indication of this species’s presence. Also gives a harsh, screaming “karrrrr” that has a gull-like quality.
