## Description from eBird:
Typical treecreeper, brown above and white below with a short decurved bill and a long stiff tail. White is brightest on the throat and fades into gray on the lower breast and belly. Fine dark barring on the tail distinguishes this species from otherwise identical relatives in its range. Inhabits high-altitude coniferous and mixed forests, where it can often be found trailing along with mixed-species flocks.
