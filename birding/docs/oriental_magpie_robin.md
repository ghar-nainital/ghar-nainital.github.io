## Description from eBird:
A medium-sized robin with a broad white wingbar running from the shoulder to the tip of the wing. Note white outertail feathers, particularly when in flight. Males sport black-and-white plumage while the females are grayish brown and white. Juveniles resemble females, but have a scaly head and upperparts. They have a good repertoire of melodious calls and are known to imitate other bird calls. The most commonly heard call is a whistle given at dawn. Most often seen singing from a high exposed perch. These birds are often seen in cultivated areas, open woodlands, and gardens.
