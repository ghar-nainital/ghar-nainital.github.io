## Observation
Probably the most common bird here after house sparrows, large-billed crows and pidegeons. Very high pitched calls and song, a very small bird hopping around with the yellow belly being distinctive and making it easy to spot. Timid but still easy to observe from some comfortable distance.

## Description from eBird:
Delicately beautiful small warbler with a greenish back, lemon-yellow underparts, a cinder-gray head, and bright white eyebrow stripes. Somewhat similar to Yellow-bellied Warbler, but note yellow instead of white throat. Forages actively in the upper levels of broadleaf and mixed montane forest, often in open patches. Sometimes descends to lower elevations in the non-breeding season, often turning up in foothill forest edges and gardens. Song is a high-pitched “tchi-tchi-cheeseewee-cheeseewee.” Calls are high, thin double notes.
