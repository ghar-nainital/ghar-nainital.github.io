## Description from eBird:
A large forest thrush whose name describes its key feature; males are black and females are brown, but both have flashing silvery wings. Bright orange bill and eyering are eye-catching in dark forests. Forages quietly in the understory of montane and submontane broadleaf evergreen forests. Often solitary, occasionally in flocks in the winter. Tends not to visit gardens and parks like Tibetan and Chinese blackbirds, but does occasionally visit feeders at hides. Sweet, “thrushy” song consists of warbled phrases, sometimes with a slightly scratchy quality.
