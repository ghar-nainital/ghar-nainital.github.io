# Nainital

A wonderful town! We were born and raised here and so we assure you we know the ins and outs of this place. So if you've come here as a visitor, we assure you there is a lot to this place. The insights here from the locals are to help you explore the nature here. That's where the soul of this town is! 

But why this effort? We feel typical tourism has been hurting this town. So apriori, we feel putting people in touch with the nature here could help it in some way. Even if its just the trash being put in the right place, all this effort is worth it!
