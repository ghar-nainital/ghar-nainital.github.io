# Nainital

A wonderful town! We were born and raised here and so we assure you we know the ins and outs of this place. So if you've come here as a visitor, we assure you there is a lot to this place. The insights here from the locals are to help you explore the nature here. That's where the soul of this town is! 

But why this effort? We feel typical tourism has been hurting this town. So apriori, we feel putting people in touch with the nature here could help it in some way. Even if its just the trash being put in the right place, all this effort is worth it!

## Birding
If you agree that taking a stroll in nature or some arduous hike is a great way to find that peace of mind, we assure you birding will do you one up. You could be walking or hiking to de-stress yourself but those thoughts could still get to you. Birding is a very engaging activity where you with your body and mind will be present and have that headspace! 

Now did you know there are about 140 bird species which call Nainital their home? That is about 12% of number of birds you can find in India! Not bad for such a small and accessible place. We ourselves have identified 105 of them. Maybe you can help us with the rest?

You will find a dedicated section on the birds we have successfully identified here casually with information such as the location, the time, the month, some personal observations and ofcourse, all the pictures we took! We hope this will give you a good starting point to ID new birds to your life list :)

## Hiking
How about access to some scenic views? LEt us guide you through all the hikes we would do whenever we wanted an escape!
